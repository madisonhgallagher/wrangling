        "2. The standard introduced is so that each time you can repeat the same structure without having to \"reinvent the wheel\". This should make for easier data cleaning and in turn data exploration.\n",
        "3. The first sentence means that all unclean data sets are alike in that they are not prepped for analysis however the issues with the \"unclean\" data will be unique from set to set. Once converted to \"tidy dataset\" format they will share the same standardized structure. The second sentence is saying how in general when we look at a table we can identify the observations and variables (rows and columns) but the title for variable and observation may be more abstract in general and trying to identify them without the table or matrix can be unintuituve and difficult.\n",

A variable is a collection of values that measure the same attribute or property (e.g. height, color, temperature, make/model). An observation is a collection of values that measure it.\n",

Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.5. A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.  In Table 4, the columns are  values of a variable, which is income, they should be a variable themselves. Since income is actually a variable. Melting a dataset is this process of turning columns into rows.\n",

        "2. It is necessary to understand where people are living and why they choose to live where they are. In politics policy decisions will affect different groups in different ways and it is important to consider race, ethnicity, income, education, and other factors when trying to serve a certain area and group of people.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. I think the choice to allow people to self identify their race was the correct choice, forcing people to limit their identity to a certian category could be inauthentic or limiting. Looking at the 2020 ACS questionnaire it appeared to be a binary option for \"sex\", going forward it may be more inclusive to have additional options or give the user the ability to self identify outside of the binary male/female options.\n",
        "The ACS did use check boxes for race and ehtnicity which seems like it could be improved upon and follow in US Census steps and allow for race to be self identified to allow for people to share that information as accurately and inclusively as possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. For the decennial US Census questionnaire the options to identify sex were male or female check boxes with specific instruction to check only one box. As mentioned in Q3 there may be people who don't easiy identify with either category so potentially they include a nonbinary or self identify option. Another issue could be the difference between sex assigned at birt versus self identified. They may need to clarify what information they are seeking as those two answers could be different for a number of people.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Because characteristics like sex, gender, sexual identity and race can be considered a spectrum or a categorical variable you are inviting an infinite number of types of responses. This will make it difficult to identify where to draw lines and group people, which you tend to have to do when analyzing categorical variables.\n",
        "A well made point in the \"solutions\" was that when people choose to NOT make a selection to a question that in itself is a response with meaning. Whether it's that they don't identify with the given answers or they feel that their true answer is more complex then the istructions allow, to try and force their non answer into a predetermined category that we have defined as \"correct\" would be inauthentic and micontrue the user's true meaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. My understanding of an algorithm would be that it takes know pieces of informations and makes judgements on unknown information, so a very good stereotyper essentially. Even the best algorithms will not have a perfect guess rate and using one to assign sensitive characteristics like race, genger, and sex will undoubtedly cause some users to be misidentified."
